Welcome! I am  a Research Fellow at the [Research Department (RES) of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)](https://www.iadb.org/en/about-us/departments/res) in Washington DC. I have a masterâ€™s degree in economics from [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics), and an undergraduate degree in Economics from the [Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)](https://www.face.ufmg.br/departamentos/ciencias-economicas/o-departamento.html). 

My research interests lie in the fields of behavioral, development, and political economy, especially in questions related to how norms and beliefs interact with institutions. I am also broadly interested in questions related to prefereces formation and discrimination. 

I have two ongoing research projects. The first one, joint with Juan Pablo Chauvin and Miguel Talamas (RES-IDB), aims at estimating the effects of changes in the minimum legal age of sexual consent (MAoC) in Mexican States on outcomes such as early fertility, early marriage, and crime incidence. The second one, joint with Juan Pablo Chauvin, seeks to estimate how the reelection probabilities of Brazilian mayors are affected by election-week COVID-19 deaths that are unrelated to the mayors' policy choices. For my MSc dissertation (available upon request), I investigated the effects of the 4G mobile internet roll-out on mental health in the UK.

In my free time I like playing Brazilian music with friends, reading literature, and enjoying the nature.
