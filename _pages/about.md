I am an aspiring applied micro-economist and a Research Fellow at the [Research Department (RES) of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)](https://www.iadb.org/en/about-us/departments/res), in Washington DC, where I work under the supervision of [Juan Pablo Chauvin](https://www.jpchauvin.com/). I have a master’s degree in economics from [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics), and an undergraduate degree in Economics from the [Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)](https://www.face.ufmg.br/departamentos/ciencias-economicas/o-departamento.html), Brazil. I am broadly interested in the fields of behavioral and health economics, economics of family and gender, and political economy. More recently I became interested in the long-term causes and consequences of discriminatory gender norms, as well as of risky and violent behavior. I am also interested in studying policy remedies, such as interventions targeting men’s behavior and beliefs (e.g. [Burzstyn et al, 2020](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20180975); [Dhar et al, 2022](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20201112)).
