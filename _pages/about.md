Welcome! I am  a PhD student at the [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/degrees/phd-program/areas-of-study/global-economics-and-management/meet-the-students/rafael-macedo-rubi%C3%A3o). I am part of the Global Economics and Management Department, at the Anderson School of Management. Previously, I worked for the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org) and the [Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)](https://www.iadb.org/en/about-us/departments/res). I have a masterâ€™s degree in economics with Distinction from the [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics), and an undergraduate degree in Economics from the [Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)](https://www.face.ufmg.br/departamentos/ciencias-economicas/o-departamento.html). 

My research interests lie in the fields of behavioral, development, and political economy, especially in questions related to how norms and beliefs interact with institutions. I am also broadly interested in questions related to preferences formation and discrimination. 

I have three ongoing research projects [Research Page under construction]. 

The first one, joint with Juan Pablo Chauvin and Miguel Talamas (RES-IDB), aims at estimating the effects of changes in the minimum legal age of sexual consent in Mexican States on outcomes such as early fertility, early marriage, and crime incidence. 

The second one, also with Juan Pablo Chauvin and Miguel Talamas, seeks to understand the size of the undercounting of teenage mothers around the globe and the mechanisms behind it.

The third one, joint with Julian Martinez-Correa (UChicago), estimates how much negative labor market experiences affect people's political leaning and voting behavior, and the reasons behind it.

For my MSc dissertation (available upon request), I investigated the effects of the 4G mobile internet roll-out on mental health in the UK.

In my free time I like playing Brazilian music with friends, reading literature, and enjoying the nature.
