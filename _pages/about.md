Welcome! I am  a Research Fellow at the [Research Department (RES) of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB)](https://www.iadb.org/en/about-us/departments/res) in Washington DC. I have a masterâ€™s degree in economics from [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/economics), and an undergraduate degree in Economics from the [Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG)](https://www.face.ufmg.br/departamentos/ciencias-economicas/o-departamento.html). 

My research interests lie in the fields of behavioral, development, and political economy, especially in questions related to how norms and beliefs interact with institutions. I am also broadly interested in questions related to prefereces formation and discrimination.
